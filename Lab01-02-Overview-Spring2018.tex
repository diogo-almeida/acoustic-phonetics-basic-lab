\section{Overview}

This is the first lab of the semester. It is divided in three parts. In the first part, you will be measuring the values of the first two formants (F1 and F2) for English vowels. In the second part, you will be trying to find acoustic correlates of stop consonants in English. In the third and final part, you will be measuring acoustic information responsible for making the difference between voiced and unvoiced stop consonants like, for instance, between [b] and [p].

In order to perform these acoustic measurements, you'll be using \Praat{} on a set of files that are provided together with this document. \Praat{} is a free, cross--platform, open--source phonetic analysis package that can be downloaded from \href{http://www.praat.org}{http://www.praat.org}, and is straightforward to install. However, in case you have any difficulty installing \Praat{}, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
